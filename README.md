INTRODUCTION:
This is my amazing first project at NYCDA: A personal portfolio website.

Our task was to pick a front-end framework of our choice, and to practise HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery.

After looking at various frameworks, I decided to use Materialize because there are tons of documentation and it had all functionalities I wanted to use.
