<h1>INTRODUCTION:</h1>
<p>This is my amazing first project at NYCDA: A personal portfolio website.<br>

Our task was to pick a front-end framework of our choice, and to practise HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery.<br>

After looking at various frameworks, I decided to use Materialize because there are tons of documentation and it had all functionalities I wanted to use.<br>
